The UI is inteneded to offer the following functionality:

1. Viewing all the items in the store displayed in a data grid view,
2. Selecting items and adding them to the cart,
3. Letting the user remove a certain number of the selected item from the cart,
4. Viewing all the items in the cart also in a data grid view,
5. Viewing all the items in the store by category,
6. Searching store items using description,
7. Viewing specifications for the selected item,
8. Applying a discount coupon to the purchases.

All the functionality can be performed using the buttons provided on the UI.
